# CLIMATEREADY 'Thermal Comfort Survey Amid Heatwaves' Dataset

This repository gives you access to the CLIMATEREADY survey dataset containing thermal comfort votes during the 2021 and 2022 heatwave periods in Pamplona, Spain, as well as other relevant parameters self-reported by surveyees (e.g. occupant characteristics and behaviour, key building/dwelling characteristics), used as case study for the research paper **Exploring indoor thermal comfort and its causes and consequences amid heatwaves in a Southern European cityâ€” An unsupervised learning approach**. 

This dataset is part of the [CLIMATEREADY research project](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/a85fb262378b49dc87381261a2e53c91). Its goal is to assess the adaptability of Spanish homes to global warming, promote passive measures in the design and use of buildings to achieve adequate indoor environmental conditions in summer conditions and in heat wave events, minimise and quantify the risks of overheating with the minimum energy demand for cooling when conditions make it necessary.
