# CLIMATEREADY research project

This repository gives you access to the CLIMATEREADY heatwave-campaign survey dataset containing thermal comfort votes during the 2021 and 2022 heatwave periods in Pamplona, Spain, as well as other relevant parameters self-reported by surveyees (e.g. occupant characteristics and behaviour, key building/dwelling characteristics). This repo also contains the code for performing the data analysis of the research paper **Exploring indoor thermal comfort and its causes and consequences amid heatwaves in a Southern European cityâ€” An unsupervised learning approach**. 

In overall, the [CLIMATEREADY research project](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/a85fb262378b49dc87381261a2e53c91) assesses the adaptability of Spanish homes to global warming, promoting passive measures in the design and use of buildings to achieve adequate indoor environmental conditions in summer conditions and in heat wave events, minimising and quantifying the risks of overheating, and with the minimum energy demand for cooling when conditions make it necessary.
